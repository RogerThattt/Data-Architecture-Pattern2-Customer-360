Architectural Principles
This design is guided by the following modern data platform principles:

Centralized Data Platform: Utilize Snowflake as the single source of truth for all analytics, AI, and application data to eliminate silos.
Separation of Storage and Compute: Leverage a cloud data platform architecture to scale resources for ingestion, transformation, and consumption independently and cost-effectively.
Batch and Real-time Processing: Natively support both continuous data streaming for real-time insights and large-scale batch processing for historical analysis.
Secure and Governed Data Access: Ensure data is shared securely without unnecessary duplication, both internally and with external partners.
Extensibility: Provide flexible mechanisms to integrate with a wide ecosystem of tools, external APIs, and applications.
